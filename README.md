**To enhance the structure and maintainability of your Flask application, you can refactor the code by breaking it down into modular functions and keeping the core application logic organized. Below is the refactored code with functions for loading templates, handling user sessions, and managing cart operations.**

Create a base template (base.html) that includes the common elements (like the navigation bar).

Extend this base template in the other HTML files (index.html, cart.html, login.html, and register.html).



# Flask + Vercel

[Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).



## How it Works

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.
